Solutions to the labs

## Bandit

I have a script to solve most levels automatically. 
There are some too difficult to make where I simply commented the solution and added the password to the solutions file.

install sshpass to execute script (works on Linux)

passwords file has all passwords, each line for each level, ordered.
LEVEL_PASS and LEVEL_PASS_N are script variables helpful to save data for the solution script. don't mind them.

Each level has the solution in the script **solution.sh** where you can learn.
